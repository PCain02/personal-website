            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Water quality monitoring is crucial for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems and ensuring safe water resources. Traditional monitoring methods often involve labor-intensive processes and limited data collection points. To address these challenges, our team developed <strong>AquaGator</strong>, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to enhance the efficiency and scope of water quality assessments.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-is-aquagator">What is AquaGator?</h2>
            <p>
                AquaGator is an innovative AUV equipped with advanced sensors to measure various water quality parameters, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Its autonomous capabilities allow it to navigate predefined routes, collect data in real-time, and transmit findings for analysis. This technology enables continuous monitoring without the need for constant human intervention.
            </p>

            <h2 id="importance-of-aquagator">Importance of AquaGator</h2>
            <p>
                The development of AquaGator represents a significant advancement in environmental monitoring for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Data Collection:</strong> AquaGator's ability to operate autonomously allows for more frequent and comprehensive data collection across various water bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By reducing the need for manual sampling, AquaGator lowers the overall costs associated with water quality monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Its design enables deployment in diverse aquatic environments, including areas that may be challenging for human access.</li>
                <li><strong>Timely Interventions:</strong> Continuous data collection facilitates early detection of water quality issues, allowing for prompt corrective actions to protect aquatic life and human health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="construction-of-aquagator">Construction of AquaGator</h2>
            <p>
                The construction of AquaGator involved meticulous planning and execution. The build process was guided by detailed instructions available in our repository, which can be accessed here: <a href="https://github.com/Underwater-Robotic-System/Build-Instructions" target="_blank">AquaGator Build Instructions</a>. The construction phases included:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Design and Build Frame:</strong> Developing a robust and hydrodynamic frame to house all components.</li>
                <li><strong>Propulsion System:</strong> Installing thrusters and control surfaces to enable precise movement and navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Power System:</strong> Integrating batteries and power management systems to ensure sustained operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Systems:</strong> Implementing both analog and digital control systems for reliable autonomous functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> Equipping the AUV with necessary sensors for real-time water quality data collection.</li>
                <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> Ensuring all electronic components are adequately protected against water ingress.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Developing software algorithms for autonomous navigation and data processing.</li>
