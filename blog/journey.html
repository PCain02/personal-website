            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Studying as a double major in Computer Science and Art at Allegheny College has been an incredible journey. 
                Balancing the technical rigor of programming with the creative freedom of art has allowed me to explore 
                interdisciplinary connections and grow both as a scientist and an artist.
            </p>

            <h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science Journey</h2>
            <p>
                In Computer Science, I’ve delved into topics like Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Robotics. 
                These courses have taught me how to solve complex problems and think algorithmically.
            </p>

            <h2 id="art-journey">Art Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My Art courses have pushed me to think creatively and experiment with mediums like mixed media, 
                photography, and 3D modeling.
            </p>

            <h2 id="highlight-project">Highlight Project</h2>
            <p>
                One of the highlights of my journey was working on a project that combined both fields: creating an 
                interactive art installation powered by Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This project showcased how technology 
                and art can come together to create something truly unique.
            </p>

            <h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
                As I approach graduation, I’m excited to continue exploring the intersection of these two fields in my 
                career. Whether it’s through creative coding, interactive design, or innovative problem-solving, I’m 
                eager to make an impact.
