            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into web design began as a curiosity and quickly turned into a passion. Learning how to create
                visually appealing and functional websites has been both challenging and rewarding. In this post, I'll
                share my experience, insights, and tips for those starting out. In fact, the website you're reading this on
                is one that I built myself!
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-is-web-design">What is Web Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Web design is the process of creating and styling websites, ensuring they are both visually appealing and
                user-friendly. It encompasses several disciplines, including layout design, typography, color theory, and
                responsiveness across devices.

            <h2 id="my-experience">My Experience as a Beginner</h2>
            <p>
                Starting with HTML and CSS was exciting, but I quickly realized there was much more to learn. Understanding
                JavaScript, responsive design, and UI/UX principles took time. Through trial and error, I improved by
                working on small projects, analyzing existing websites, and seeking feedback.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tips-for-beginners">Tips for Beginners</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the basics: Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before diving into frameworks.</li>
                <li>Build small projects: Practice is the best way to improve your skills.</li>
                <li>Learn about UX/UI design: A good website is more than just code; it's about the user experience.</li>
                <li>Keep up with trends: Web design evolves, so staying updated is essential.</li>
                <li>Use online resources: Platforms like MDN, W3Schools, and FreeCodeCamp offer excellent tutorials.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="useful-tools">Useful Tools & Resources</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some tools that have helped me along the way:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code Editors:</strong> VS Code, Sublime Text</li>
