            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Wigglegrams are a fascinating way to bring depth and motion to still images. By rapidly alternating between 
                two slightly different perspectives, they create an illusion of three-dimensionality. This technique is not 
                just a gimmick—it can enhance storytelling, evoke emotion, and add a unique touch to visual work.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-are-wigglegrams">What Are Wigglegrams?</h2>
            <p>
                Wigglegrams are a type of stereoscopic image that simulates depth by shifting between two images captured 
                from slightly different angles. Unlike traditional 3D photography, wigglegrams don’t require special glasses—
                the motion itself creates the effect.

                In photography and digital art, depth perception is crucial for immersion. Wigglegrams enhance depth in a 
                way that static images cannot, making them valuable in fields like advertising, social media, and fine art. 
                They add an interactive feel to images, grabbing attention in a crowded digital landscape.

                The process of making a wigglegram involves capturing at least two images from slightly different angles and 
                then alternating them in quick succession. Software like Photoshop, After Effects, or even simple online tools 
                can be used to animate the transition. Proper alignment and consistent framing are key to a smooth effect.

            <h2 id="historical-wigglegrams">Historical Wigglegrams</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the wigglegrams featured here originate from historical stereoscopic collections, including museum 
                archives dedicated to early 3D photography. These images, captured over a century ago, serve as a testament 
                to the enduring fascination with depth and motion in photography. By adapting them into wigglegrams, I aim 
                to give new life to these vintage perspectives, connecting past techniques with modern digital artistry.

            <p>
                Wigglegrams have played a significant role in my artistic practice. I use them to enhance portraits, add 
                movement to still-life photography, and experiment with surreal perspectives. Their ability to create a sense 
                of life and energy makes them a valuable addition to my creative toolkit.
