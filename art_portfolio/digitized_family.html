            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My work explores the evolving relationship between humanity and technology. As a creative technologist, I use my art to unravel what it means to be human in an increasingly digitized world. I am fascinated by the dynamic interplay between organic creativity and non-human systems—especially as artificial intelligence and emerging technologies continue to evolve.

            <h2 id="themes-and-process">Themes and Process</h2>
            <p>
                Central to my work is the exploration of personhood and how it is reshaped by technology. I often gravitate toward themes like personification, uncanny imagery, and speculative realities—spaces where human traits bleed into machines, and vice versa.

            </div>
            <p>
                My process is highly experimental and fluid. I often begin a piece without a predetermined outcome, allowing intuition and technology to shape the final result. I embrace a variety of mediums and tools including artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer visualization, always seeking new ways to push creative boundaries. This process-driven approach highlights both the contrasts and the connections between human and machine ways of thinking.

            <h2 id="technology-and-ethics">Technology and Ethics</h2>
            <p>
                The emotional tension in my work often lies in the balance between the familiar and the uncanny. By presenting viewers with alternate realities and semi-recognizable forms, I invite them to question their assumptions about identity and the future. I also weave ethical concerns into each project—particularly in relation to sustainability and the moral impact of rapid technological advancement.

            <p>
                As humanity grows more entwined with its own creations, I believe artists and technologists must work with a strong sense of responsibility. Technology should be approached thoughtfully, not just for what it can do but for how it reshapes our cultural and emotional landscapes.
            </p>

            <h2 id="featured-work">Featured Work</h2>
            <p>
                The piece currently featured in the gallery is a portrait series generated through a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Each image presents a human face that is simultaneously familiar and alien—a result of training AI on photographs of people I know personally. Through the lens of computer vision, these faces become echoes of reality, transformed and digitized.
            </p>
            <div class="project-post-image">
                <img src="images/us.webp" alt="US Image made with GAN">
            </div>
            <p>
                The portraits invoke pareidolia, where viewers perceive faces in abstract forms. Each piece feels like a distorted memory, a ghost of a person both present and absent. It’s deeply personal, yet estranged—symbolizing how our interactions with technology can both connect and distance us from what is real.
            </p>

            
            <h2 id="toydy">TOYDY</h2>
            <p>
                For the Allegheny College student art show in 2023 I took a single image from this series, "PARTNER" and submitted it solo as "TOYDY". This focuses on just on of the faces and it was the one I was most in love with both figuratively and literally. This piece won first place for digitial and photographic media. The award also came with a book and a $150 cash prize. I am very thankful for winning that award.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <div class="project-post-image">
                <img src="images/self.webp" alt="SELF Image made with GAN">
            </div>
            <p>
                Through this work, I aim to provoke dialogue about the future of identity, ethics, and human connection in a tech-driven world. By blending experimental methods with emerging technologies, my art asks viewers to contemplate what it means to be human in an age where that very concept is being rewritten.
