            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                A fragmented cyborgian woman emerges—distorted, monitored, and burdened by the weight of digital surveillance. In an era where technology intertwines with the body, tracking and measuring every pulse and anomaly, this piece embodies both the promise and the pressure of constant health monitoring.
            </p>

            <h2 id="themes-and-process">Themes and Process</h2>
            <p>
                Created during a pivotal moment in the artist’s journey—marked by newfound diagnoses of heart conditions and neurological disorders—this work is a visceral response to the intersection of illness and technology. The head contorts in the raw agony of a migraine, a visual echo of pain’s disorienting grip. Wires snake across the figure’s asymmetric arms, a glitch-like disruption in the body’s equilibrium. Monitors make up the wrist and torso, silent sentinels of data, yet amplifiers of anxiety.
            </p>

            <h2 id="technology-and-health">Technology and Health</h2>
            <p>
                The body, on the verge of collapse, is weighed down not just by illness, but by the knowledge of it—exposed, dissected, and cataloged. Monitored Cyborg speaks to our entanglement with technology: a force of both healing and harm, precision and pressure, a paradox that shapes our existence in an era of digital dependence.
            </p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Through Monitored Cyborg, the artist invites viewers to reflect on the duality of technology in our lives. It is both a tool for survival and a source of anxiety, a paradox that defines the human experience in a digital age. This piece serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between embracing innovation and preserving our humanity.
